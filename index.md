# Myth Busting

## Welcome to our myth busting website! Here you'll learn all about our contest!

### About us

We are a team of students dedicated to proving COVID-19 myths wrong for the public! We recently participated in a McMaster start coding workshop focused on stopping vaccine hesitency. We were taught about the process of design thinking, which is what we used to create this for you! Our Group chose misinformation for the topic of our project. We feel that a huge reason people don't get the vaccine, or take covid as seriously, is because of the misinformation spread about it. 
ThereÂ´s always talk about myths, rumors and uncertaintees when it comes to Covid or the Covid-19 vaccine. We as a group want to help tackle this problem and help spred true information. 
For our solution we came up with the idea of making videos! We will post short, simple videos debunking popular COVID-19 myths, _and we want you to join!_ 
All our videos are backed by research and created by our team. We will upload our videos on different media platforms, and will include links on this website to them aswell.
