# Myth Busting

## Welcome to our myth busting website! Here you'll learn all about our contest!

### About us

We are a team of students who are proving COVID myths wrong for the public! We recently joined a McMaster start coding camp focused on stopping vaccine hesitency.
Our Group chose the topic of Misinformation. We feel that a huge reason people don't get the vaccine, or take covid as seriously is because of the misinformation spread 
about it. For our solution we came up with the idea of making videos! We will post short videos debunking popular COVID-19 myths, and we want you to join! All our videos 
are research backed, by us, and created by our team. We have uploaded our videos on different media platforms, and will include links on this website to them aswell.
